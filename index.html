    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and I seemed to be lost in a vast forest.</p>
    <p>But there was a light far off...how would we reach it?</p>
    <p>I grabbed my bag and flagged down a local large bird...</p>
    <p>undertain it would respond, I flailled my arms profusely.</p>
    <p>It swooped down, and I was able to catch a claw as it came past.</p>
